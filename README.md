This is a Leap Motion app.

It is a game that requires the player to hit the pads, which are triggered to spikes in a songs audiowave.  

It takes an audio file, reads in the data, plays the song and as the song it being played to the player pads fly at the player, which the player is ment to hit and get points. Once the song is over, the score is put on a leader borad.

I will set three songs and get them configered. 

I will also use another libaray to trigger graphics as the song is played.
